                    <p>this page is clips of my life so you get a background </p>
                    <p>When I was young I was born in the UK and grow up with a family of 4 and had Xbox and an old phone to use as growing up got new phones like iPhone 4s and 6s then XR, but I was always in the games and computers didn't get a pc until 2021 or 2022 I don't remember </p>
                    <p>In school, I was very quiet and shy as I don't like talking to people I don't know, so I somehow got friends, and they went to my high school as well so though school I didn't do well because I never focus as I was doing drawing in my book, but I did do very well in ICT I got my highest grade in that class</p>
                    <p>Near 2021 or 2022 I got more in the coding and pc games as well doing woodwork also I did a little game making though Unreal Engine and unity just never got that focus on it and over finish it but got in to blender though avatar making and vrchat as I would play that game non-stop though people I talk to in the game or real life friends</p>
                    <p>I like to read a lot of books also anime I just watch that less, but I love reading most books my favourite book is hellsing it's an anime as well in an oldish style but this only happen is the past couple of years as I got older and started to make my own money and buy what ever and whenever <p>
                    <p>This again is just a bit of my life that give a bit more about me and my past and where I am started to head in the future <p>
